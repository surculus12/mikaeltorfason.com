      Harmsaga, or Tragedy, premiered in Iceland in 2013, and got brilliant reviews. 2014 it was played at The Kennedy Center in Washington, and got great reviews in English, as seen below.

      In this modern love story, a young couple desperately tries to save their marriage, exposing betrayed promises and broken dreams in the process.

      The Washington Post: "Mikael Torfason’s two-character drama, based on an actual murder case, makes August Strindberg’s grueling “Dance of Death” seem polite. It’s like an indie film update of Strindberg, with the twisted psychological games driven to explosive heights by explicit footage of an affair (hers) and animalistic roars and self-flagellation (his)."

      MD Theatre Guide: "A riveting, psychological exploration of a tortured marriage."

      Mikael Torfason was nominated for BEST PLAY at the Icelandic Theater Awards in 2013 for Tragedy.
