      Mikael Torfason's memoir.

      In his latest book Mikael Torfason tells his own story growing up in Jehovah's Witnesses. He was born very sick, and desperately needed a blood transfusion that would banish him for eternity. Torfason lived to tell the tale, obviously, but his saga is a dramatic tale of God and the devil along with Jehovah's Witnesses, hippies, doctors, Icelandic sailors, farmers, housewives, drunks, smokers and children.

      It is one crazy saga, but the truth. Lost in Paradise was a number one bestseller in Iceland.

      Story of a Girl tells the tale of a girl's maturing years and has been compared with such works as Jostein Garder's Sophie's World, Laxness' Salka Valka and The Swan by Gudbergur Bergsson. This story is about a seventeen-year old girl from Reykjavik, who is a more complex personality than she appears to be.

      “Story of a Girl contains a lot of “here and now”; it is contemporary in a more explicit sense than most novels. It is derived straight from our own times, from today’s ideas and debate about gender. The violent, primeval force of Story of a Girl is rendered through the unconventional voice of the narrator and the way language shouts out at the reader, thus blurring the boundaries between real life and the text.”
      - Hermann Stefansson, Morgunbladid Newspaper
